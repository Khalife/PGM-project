We tried the model on 2 toy examples, one made with 4 documents containing the same word and having a different word per document, and the second example with 4documents, 2 of them having a the same words in them.

For the first dataset depending on the initialisation, we can find a topic per word which correspond to what we could have expected or 2 words can be wrongfully associated in the same topic. That shows the limitations of using so many approximtions during the procedures.

For the second dataset the two topic found are the one that could have been expected , the words that are in the same document are said to be in the same topic.
